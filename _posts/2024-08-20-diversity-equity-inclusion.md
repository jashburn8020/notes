Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are organisational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination on the basis of identity or disability.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion

* **Diversity**: Representation of people from a variety of backgrounds at all levels in an organisation.
  * Includes race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, culture, class, religion, or opinion.
  * Richard Thaler: "We tend to think about [diversity] in terms of things like racial diversity and gender diversity and ethnic diversity. Those things are all important. But it's also important to have diversity in how people think." (Javetski & Koller, 2018)
* **Equity**: Fair treatment for all people, so that the norms, practices, and policies in place ensure identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes.
  * _Equality_ assumes that all people should be treated the same.
  * _Equity_ takes into consideration a person's unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the **end result** is equal.
  * Bill Schaninger: "There's a real difference between equal and equitable. Suppose we said, 'All interns are created equal. We pay them nothing.' The people who can afford an entire summer without getting paid are likely already coming from a position of privilege." (_What Is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion?_, 2022)

* **Inclusion**: How the workforce experiences the workplace and the degree to which organisations embrace all employees and enable them to make meaningful contributions.
  * Whether people feel like they belong, and whether they feel heard or valued in an organisation.
  * Diana Ellsworth: "The LGBTQ+ community is underrepresented in the workplace, especially at more senior levels. As a result, many feel like an "only" at work and are more likely to experience microaggressions; they might feel unable to talk openly and comfortably about themselves, for example, or need constantly to correct assumptions about their personal lives." (_What Is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion?_, 2022)
  * "Onlyness": Being the only one on a team or in a meeting with their given gender identity, sexual orientation, or race.

## Benefits

* Financial performance:
  * Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.
  * Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.
  * In the United States, there is a linear relationship between racial and ethnic diversity and better financial performance: for every 10% increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior-executive team, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rise 0.8%.
  * In the United Kingdom, greater gender diversity on the senior-executive team corresponded to the highest performance uplift: for every 10% increase in gender diversity, EBIT rose by 3.5 percent. (Dame Vivian Hunt et al., 2015)
* Employer of choice:
  * 76% of job seekers and employees report that a diverse workforce is an important factor when evaluating companies and job offers.
  * 32% of employees and job seekers would not apply to a job at a company where there is a lack of diversity among its workforce.
    * Significantly higher for Black (41%) job seekers and employees when compared to white (30%) job seekers and employees.
    * Also higher among LGBTQ (41%) job seekers and employees when compared to non-LGBTQ (32%) job seekers and employees. (Glassdoor Team, 2021)
* Innovation and growth:
  * Diverse companies are 70% likelier to capture a new market.
  * They are also 45% more likely to report increased market share year-over-year. (Hewlett et al., 2021)
* Increased employee engagement:
  * 83% of millennials are actively engaged when they believe their organisation fosters an inclusive culture, compared to only 60% of millennials who are actively engaged when their organisation does not foster an inclusive culture.
    * Millennials view cognitive diversity as essential for an inclusive culture that supports engagement, empowerment, and authenticity.
    * Cognitive diversity: Diversity of thoughts, ideas, and philosophies, and in solving business problems through a culture of collaboration. (Smith & Turner, 2015)
* Better decision-making:
  * Inclusive teams make better business decisions up to 87% of the time.
    * Teams outperform individual decision makers 66% of the time, and decision making improves as team diversity increases.
    * All-male teams make better business decisions 58% of the time, while gender diverse teams do so 73% of the time.
    * Teams that also include a wide range of ages and different geographic locations make better business decisions 87% of the time.
  * Decisions made and executed by diverse teams delivered 60% better results. (Larson, 2017)
