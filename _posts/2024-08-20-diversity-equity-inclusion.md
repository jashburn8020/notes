Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are organisational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination on the basis of identity or disability.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion

* **Diversity**: Representation of people from a variety of backgrounds at all levels in an organisation.
  * Includes race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, culture, class, religion, or opinion.
  * Richard Thaler: "We tend to think about [diversity] in terms of things like racial diversity and gender diversity and ethnic diversity. Those things are all important. But it's also important to have diversity in how people think." (Javetski & Koller, 2018)
* **Equity**: Fair treatment for all people, so that the norms, practices, and policies in place ensure identity is not predictive of opportunities or workplace outcomes.
  * _Equality_ assumes that all people should be treated the same.
  * _Equity_ takes into consideration a person's unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the **end result** is equal.
  * Bill Schaninger: "There's a real difference between equal and equitable. Suppose we said, 'All interns are created equal. We pay them nothing.' The people who can afford an entire summer without getting paid are likely already coming from a position of privilege." (_What Is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion?_, 2022)

* **Inclusion**: How the workforce experiences the workplace and the degree to which organisations embrace all employees and enable them to make meaningful contributions.
  * Whether people feel like they belong, and whether they feel heard or valued in an organisation.
  * Diana Ellsworth: "The LGBTQ+ community is underrepresented in the workplace, especially at more senior levels. As a result, many feel like an "only" at work and are more likely to experience microaggressions; they might feel unable to talk openly and comfortably about themselves, for example, or need constantly to correct assumptions about their personal lives." (_What Is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion?_, 2022)
  * "Onlyness": Being the only one on a team or in a meeting with their given gender identity, sexual orientation, or race.

## Benefits

* Financial performance:
  * Companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.
  * Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.
  * In the United States, there is a linear relationship between racial and ethnic diversity and better financial performance: for every 10% increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior-executive team, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rise 0.8%.
  * In the United Kingdom, greater gender diversity on the senior-executive team corresponded to the highest performance uplift: for every 10% increase in gender diversity, EBIT rose by 3.5 percent. (Dame Vivian Hunt et al., 2015)
* Employer of choice:
  * 76% of job seekers and employees report that a diverse workforce is an important factor when evaluating companies and job offers.
  * 32% of employees and job seekers would not apply to a job at a company where there is a lack of diversity among its workforce.
    * Significantly higher for Black (41%) job seekers and employees when compared to white (30%) job seekers and employees.
    * Also higher among LGBTQ (41%) job seekers and employees when compared to non-LGBTQ (32%) job seekers and employees. (Glassdoor Team, 2021)
* Innovation and growth:
  * Diverse companies are 70% likelier to capture a new market.
  * They are also 45% more likely to report increased market share year-over-year. (Hewlett et al., 2021)
* Increased employee engagement:
  * 83% of millennials are actively engaged when they believe their organisation fosters an inclusive culture, compared to only 60% of millennials who are actively engaged when their organisation does not foster an inclusive culture.
    * Millennials view cognitive diversity as essential for an inclusive culture that supports engagement, empowerment, and authenticity.
    * Cognitive diversity: Diversity of thoughts, ideas, and philosophies, and in solving business problems through a culture of collaboration. (Smith & Turner, 2015)
* Better decision-making:
  * Inclusive teams make better business decisions up to 87% of the time.
    * Teams outperform individual decision makers 66% of the time, and decision making improves as team diversity increases.
    * All-male teams make better business decisions 58% of the time, while gender diverse teams do so 73% of the time.
    * Teams that also include a wide range of ages and different geographic locations make better business decisions 87% of the time.
  * Decisions made and executed by diverse teams delivered 60% better results. (Larson, 2017)

## Criticisms

* Green and Hand (2021) revisited McKinsey's analysis using more recent data for US S&P 500 firms.
  * Found statistically insignificant relations between McKinsey's inverse normalised Herfindahl-Hirschman measures of executive racial/ethnic diversity and various financial metrics.
  * Inverse normalised Herfindahl-Hirschman index: A measure of concentration or diversity -- higher value indicates more diversity (lower concentration).
* Dwyer et al. (2003) examined the influence of gender diversity in management on firm performance.
  * Studies of diversity's impact on performance at the top management team level have reported mixed and often contradictory results.
    * Suggesting the influence of other contextual variables on this relationship.
    * Diversity's positive influences (gender diversity in particular) may be more fully realised when examined not only across senior-level executives who formulate strategy but also across midlevel managers who implement strategy.
  * Gender diversity's effects at the management level is moderated by:
    * the firm's growth/strategic orientation,
    * the organisational culture in which it resides, and/or
    * the multivariate interaction among these variables.
  * The potential benefits of gender diversity such as novel insights, perspectives, creativity, and experience appear to foster and support expansion into new markets.
  * Some support was found for the interaction between gender diversity and the **clan culture type** in relation to firm performance.
    * (4 main organisational culture types within the Competing Values Framework: Clan, Adhocracy, Market, and Hierarchy.)
    * The potentially beneficial aspects of gender diversity appear to require a more nurturing, employee-focused setting before they can be fully realised.
    * The clan's core values of teamwork, participation, and cohesiveness appear to provide an environment that fosters the varied skills and abilities of a diverse workforce.
    * This collectivist setting may be necessary to prevent the formation of in-groups, polarisation, and discrimination predicted by social identity theory.
      * Social identity theory: Individuals derive a portion of their self-concept from their membership in social groups.
        * Social identity groups can give a sense of belonging, purpose, self-worth, and identity.
        * People have a natural inclination to perceive their in-group in a positive light while being neutral or even negative towards out-groups. (McLeod, 2023)
    * Gender diversity did _not_ provide benefits to firms with an _adhocracy_ culture type.
      * Clan culture type focuses inward on the firm and employees, placing high value on integration, teamwork, and other internal processes.
      * Adhocracy culture type has a results-oriented external focus that places priority on competition and interaction with the environment, and relatively lower level of employee-focused orientation.
        * Relatively less supportive environment that potentially dampens an atmosphere of open-minded consideration.
      * Competition: Studies have found that women are more cooperative than men; men, conversely, embrace competitive individualism.
        * Contrasting styles may tend to hinder performance, particularly within an adhocracy culture.
    * Firms planning to increase their current level of gender diversity may be advised to cultivate a set of organisational values that focus closely on:
      * employee affiliation and consensus-building,
      * paternal leadership styles, and
      * strategic emphases that are internally oriented and informal.
  * Notes on the study:
    * Set in a single industry and, as such, the generalisation of results to other settings should be exercised with caution.
    * Although relationships between various interaction variables and firm performance were found, no causal relationships should be inferred.
    * The study should be extended to include other visible aspects of cultural diversity such as race and age.
* Kearney and Gebert (2009) examined **transformational leadership** as a moderator of the relationship of age, nationality, and educational background diversity with team outcomes.
  * Nationality and educational diversity were positively related to team performance when levels of transformational leadership were high.
    * These relationships were nonsignificant when transformational leadership was low.
  * Age diversity was not related to team performance when transformational leadership was high.
    * It was negatively related to team performance when transformational leadership was low.
  * 2 mediated moderation effects help explain these findings.
    * Transformational leadership moderated the relationship of the 3 examined diversity dimensions with the elaboration of task-relevant information, which in turn was positively associated with team performance.
    * Moreover, transformational leadership moderated the relationship of the 3 diversity types with collective team identification, which in turn was positively related to the elaboration of task-relevant information.
  * Concepts:
    * **Transformational leadership** -- consists of 4 main components:
      * _Intellectual Stimulation_: Emphasising new experiences, new opportunities (to grow and learn), and innovative ways of thinking.
      * _Individual Consideration_: Transformational leaders are concerned with the professional development of employees and foster positive relationships with them -- keeping lines of communication open, attending to the individual needs of employees, mentoring them and recognising each person's unique contributions.
      * _Inspirational Motivation_: Transformational leaders give employees a strong sense of purpose and set high standards and expectations for achievement by setting the high standards and expectations for themselves and then modelling it for their employees and the organisation as a whole.
      * _Idealised Influence_: Transformational leaders serve as role models for employees in every way, that also include modelling ethical and socially desirable behaviour, maintaining a dedication to work goals, and exhibiting enthusiasm about company strategy. (Jenniferd, 2022)
    * **Elaboration of task-relevant information**: The exchange, discussion, and integration of ideas, knowledge, and insights pertaining to assigned tasks.
    * **Collective team identification**: The emotional significance that individuals attach to their membership in a given team.
    * **Mediation**: How an effect from an independent variable (IV) to a dependent variable (DV) is mediated.
      * The mediator is a third variable which is influenced by the IV and in turn influences the DV.
    * **Moderation**: What affects the strength (and direction, if any) of an effect.
      * The moderator is a third variable that affects the strength of the effect of the IV on the DV.
    * **Mediated moderation**:
      * The strength of the relationship between an IV and a DV depends on a moderator variable (MOD).
      * A mediated moderation exists if this moderator effect is applied to an indirect path from the IV to the DV via a mediator (MED).
      * So there is an indirect effect, the strength of which depends on the moderator and therefore the strength of the overall effect depends on the moderator. (Regorz, 2019)
      * In this study:
        * Transformational leadership acts as a MOD.
          * It influences the strength of the relationship between team diversity (IV) and team performance (DV).
        * The moderating effect of transformational leadership on the relationship between diversity and performance is mediated by:
          * _Elaboration of task-relevant information_:
            * Transformational leadership influences how well the team discusses and integrates diverse perspectives, which in turn affects performance.
          * _Collective team identification_:
            * Transformational leadership also impacts how strongly team members identify with the team, which then influences the extent of information elaboration and ultimately, performance. (OpenAI, 2024)
